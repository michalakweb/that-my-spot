		trueName: "Tape recorder AKAI 4000DS",
		description:
			"This reel-to-reel tape recorder was made by Akai, a Japanese company based in Tokio, now defunct. Produced in 1972-1973, it was considered a luxury product (almost everything produced outside of the Soviet Union was considered that).\n \n Tape recorders were extremely popular in the Eastern Block. Poland at the time didn't have extensive copyright laws and many radio stations played western albums in their entirety, so people could record them with tape recorders. Availability of western music was scarce and the prices too high for an average citizen."
